Hi, I’m John

ABOUT ME:<br>
I’m currently in school pursuing a bachelors in computer science. I've previously completed Harvard's CS50 and am now working through the Odin Project's Javascript Pathway and Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning. I am an officer in the school's WiCyS cybersecurity club, a member of the school robotics club, and working with the school to form an official programming club. I also participate in various cybersecurity competitions with the school team such as the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. I'm spending whatever free time I have left dabbling in Python, microcontrollers, and exploring experimental visualization and signal processesing with Max MSP, Touchdesigner & Juce.

I’m interested in learning computer science and programming in order to try to make the world a better and more enjoyable place to live. I'm interested in both music and the environment, and looking for innovative ways to integrate forward thinking technologies into these areas.

I’m looking to collaborate on moderate sized and beginner friendly projects, preferably of the open source variety.
