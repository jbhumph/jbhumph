# Hi, I’m John

## ABOUT ME:<br>
I’m currently in school pursuing a BS in computer science / software engineering. I've essentially wrapped up an AAS in software development at Whatcom Community College and am preparing to transfer and finish out a BS at a university. I'm the president of the WCC Programming Club. I'm also secretary of WiCyS, the school's cybersecurity club. I've previously completed Harvard's CS50 and am now working through the Odin Project's Javascript Pathway and Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning. I also participate in various cybersecurity competitions with the school team such as the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. I'm spending whatever free time I have left dabbling in Python, microcontrollers, and exploring experimental visualization and signal processesing with Max MSP, Touchdesigner & Juce.

I’m interested in learning computer science and programming in order to try to make the world a better and more enjoyable place to live. I'm interested in both music and the environment, and looking for innovative ways to integrate forward thinking technologies into these areas.

I’m looking to collaborate on moderate sized and beginner friendly projects, preferably of the open source variety.

## PORTFOLIO:<br>
Please check out the code for a number of my pinned projects below. Additionally, several web based projects are deployed and are viewable at the following:

### Steganography Application:

- [Stega-Pal](https://github.com/jbhumph/stega_pal) - A GUI application written utilizing Python and PySide 6 and utilizing libraries such as Pillow, cryptography, etc. Provides steganography encoding and decoding services. Currently in MVP form with working image encoding / decoding using LSB method and options for bit planes, channel selection, cryptography. Many more features coming soon!
