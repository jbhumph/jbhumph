- 👋 Hi, I’m @jbhumph
- 👀 I’m interested in learning computer science and programming in order to try to make the world a better and more enjoyable place to live. I'm interested in both music and the environment and looking for innovative ways to integrate forward thinking technologies into these areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently in school pursuing a degree in software development. I've previously completed Harvard's CS50 and am now working through the Odin Project. I'm spending whatever free time I have left dabbling in Python, microcontrollers, Max MSP, Touchdesigner & Juce.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on moderate sized and beginner friendly projects, preferably of the open source variety.
- 📫 How to reach me : jbhumph@gmail.com
